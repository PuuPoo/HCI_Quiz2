In the Final Project screenshot seen above, the design pattern of Navigation was utilized. This was utilized because it perfectly fits our feature needed in our final project. Since our final project was making a app/website for students and lecturers to see their own performance, forum, classes, and students, we needed to implement a navigation bar on top of the website to ensure students and or lecturers are able to navigate effectively within the website to travel between HTML screens in order to reach their desired information. This solves the problem of cognitive load. This solves it by remove the target audience's need to remember different paths to reach their desired path (example: having to traverse a specific page to reach another page). This will improve user improvement since users will easily be able to navigate easily on the top of the screen without having the need to remember the specific path to reach a specific screen.

In the Final Project screenshot seen above, the design pattern of layout and structure was utilized. This was utilized because it perfectly fits our feature needed in our final project. Our final project needed us to clearly seperate different classes for lecturers. This means that we needed a way to clearly indicate to the user that different buttons will lead to a different class depending on the seperation and the name on the buttons. Thus, resulting in a requirement for a clear layout and structure that tells the user clearly on the seperation of the content and improve its readability and understanding. This fixes the HCI problem of inefficiency and errors. By designing and utilizing an effective layout and structure in our final project, it mitigates the risk that users will accidentally make any mistakes in our application thus, leading to a more efficient solution. This will improve user experience since users will be least likely to make any mistakes that will hamper their experience while using the application.
